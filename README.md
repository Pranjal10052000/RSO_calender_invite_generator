# RSO_calender_invite_generator
This repo contains python code to generate calendar invite for monthly schedule for Resident security officers at Northeastern University. This is not an official resource. This is a fun project made by me for the ease of converting the RSO shifts to calendar invites

- To help this code work for desired output, Upload ur teamworks schedule pdf for any month to this website and convert it to the csv file
- https://products.groupdocs.app/conversion/pdf-to-csv
- run the RSO_cal() function and input ur csv file name and name of the calender file(.ics) u want (this is, so that u can convert calender invites with specific details like month or person's name)
- once the file is created run the file by clicking and it will add the invites to ur calender.
